# VRoam
VRoam is a concept e-commerce full-stack application built with Ruby on Rails. I made this full-stack CRUD app with a concept of a shopping cart for my second project of General Assembly's Web Development Immersive Program.

## About
VRoam is my first Ruby on Rails project. It has a user model, order model, product model, and cart model. It includes a sign up/log in functionality and a shopping cart that stores items. 

## The Design
The project's user stories are documented and managed on Trello, which can be found here: https://trello.com/b/XxhflO3c/vroam
